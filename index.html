          <h2>Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
          <p>
            Introduce students to JavaScript, a versatile and widely-used
            programming language that forms one of the core technologies of the
            web alongside HTML and CSS. Explain how JavaScript allows developers
            to add interactivity, dynamic content, and automation to websites,
            turning static pages into engaging user experiences. Discuss how it
            is supported by all modern browsers and plays a vital role in
            enhancing the responsiveness and functionality of web applications.
            Additionally, highlight how JavaScript is used in both front-end and
            back-end development, making it an essential skill in web
            development.

        <div class="section-content strategy">
          <h2>JavaScript Variables and Data Types</h2>
          <p>
            Teach students the fundamentals of variables in JavaScript, which
            are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated
            throughout a program. Explain the different ways to declare
            variables using <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and
            <code>const</code>, and emphasize the scope and use cases of each.
            Delve into JavaScript data types such as strings, numbers, booleans,
            arrays, and objects, explaining how each type is used to represent
            different kinds of information. Provide examples of how data types
            are essential in controlling logic, manipulating content, and
            building interactive elements within web applications.

          <h2>JavaScript Objects and SDG 9</h2>
          <p>
            Explore the concept of JavaScript objects, which are fundamental to
            modern programming and represent collections of related data and
            functionality. Demonstrate how objects contain properties (key-value
            pairs) and methods (functions) that perform actions on the data.
            Provide examples of how objects are used in real-world applications,
            from managing user data to creating complex user interfaces.
            Furthermore, link the significance of programming skills, such as
            object-oriented programming, to SDG 9, which promotes innovation,
            infrastructure development, and the growth of sustainable
            industries. Highlight how JavaScript enables developers to build
            cutting-edge, scalable, and efficient digital infrastructures,
            contributing to global progress in the digital economy.

          <h2>Functions and Control Structures</h2>
          <p>
            Help students develop a deep understanding of functions, which are
            reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. Explain
            the syntax for declaring and invoking functions, including how
            functions can accept parameters and return values. Introduce control
            structures such as conditionals (if-else statements) and loops (for,
            while), which are essential for making decisions and repeating tasks
            based on specific conditions. These concepts are crucial for writing
            efficient, logical code that can handle a variety of scenarios in
            web applications. Provide examples where control structures are used
            to build dynamic web components, such as form validation and user
            input handling.

          <h2>JavaScript Events and DOM Manipulation</h2>
          <p>
            Encourage students to explore event-driven programming in
            JavaScript, which allows web pages to respond to user actions such
            as clicks, key presses, or form submissions. Explain how events are
            at the core of interactivity, enabling developers to create dynamic,
            responsive user interfaces. Introduce the concept of DOM (Document
            Object Model) manipulation, showing how JavaScript can be used to
            select, modify, and update HTML elements on the fly, enabling
            real-time updates to web content without needing a page refresh.
            Provide examples of DOM manipulation, such as dynamically adding new
            elements to a webpage, changing styles, or updating the content
            based on user input. These skills are crucial for creating engaging,
            modern web applications.
